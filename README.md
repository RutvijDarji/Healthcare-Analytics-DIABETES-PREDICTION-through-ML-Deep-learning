# Healthcare-Analytics-DIABETES-PREDICTION-through-ML-Deep-learning
Diabetes Prediction is a critical endeavor in healthcare due to the pervasive impact of diabetes on 
individuals and society. Diabetes, characterized by the body's inability to regulate blood glucose 
effectively, leads to severe complications such as heart disease, vision impairment, and kidney 
disease. Therefore, the development of predictive models for diabetes risk is imperative for public health officials and 
healthcare practitioners. By harnessing predictive modeling techniques, this project 
aims to contribute to early detection efforts, ultimately improving outcomes and reducing the 
socioeconomic and economic burden associated with diabetes.
# Data Abstract
The Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset was created with the aim of investigating the correlation 
between lifestyle factors and diabetes within the United States population. Funded by the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), this dataset comprises healthcare statistics and lifestyle 
survey responses from a large sample of individuals. Each instance in the dataset represents a participant in the study, providing valuable insights into 
demographics, lab test results, and lifestyle habits. With 253,680 instances and 21 features, 
including categorical and integer data types, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for diabetes
diagnosis.
# Research Questions
* Which health indicators exhibit the strongest association with the prediction of diabetes?
* How does the model perform in terms of sensitivity (individuals with diabetes) and specificity (individuals without diabetes)?
* Can the model be extended for early detection and prevention strategies?
